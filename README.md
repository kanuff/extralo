## About
*"If you can see it, you can edit"*\

Extralo is a project-management app that helps users organize their workflow. With simple styling, intuitive controls, and a core philosophy of **"Organize just enough to do it"** , Extralo stays out of the way of what actually matters - getting work done.

## Features

The main organizational unit in Extralo is a **Board**. Boards can contain an arbitrary amount of **Lists**, which in turn can contain an arbitrary amount of **Cards**. There are no restrictions imposed on the internal structure of a Board, allowing the user to decide how they want to organize the structure of their project.
